Lindenmayer system (L system) is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar.

An L system consists  Alphabets ,rules, Axioms and mechanism . 
-	Alphabets of symbols to make strings.
-	Production rules to expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols.
-	Axiom  , the initial string  from which to begin construction.
-	Mechanism to translate the generated string into geometric structure.

 Grammar for this L-system :
-	Variables=0,F,E;
-	Start=0;
-	Rules=0->E,E->E;

Here E means taking midpoint of every line and joining the midpoints to form a closed figure

0 is window which is our starting point.
